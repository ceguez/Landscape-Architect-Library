# landscape-architect-plant-library
A prototype for an e-library which allows users to create, search, update, and delete information about plants based on the needs of Landscape Architects. The back -end is a CRUD REST service and the front-end uses reactive programming. Note: This code represents the MVP version; it does not expose anything from the official prototype.

This is a collection of requests tested on the server: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16169448/UV5Rmfa1
